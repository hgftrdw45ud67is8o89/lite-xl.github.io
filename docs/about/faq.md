# FAQ

## Why Lite XL?

Lite XL is a fork of [lite], an amazing text editor by [rxi].
Francesco forked lite to add sub-pixel font rendering,
which significantly improves how text looks but brings in
huge dependencies ([FreeType] and [AGG]) and complicates text rendering.
This change was [rejected] by rxi as lite values simplicity.

Eventually, more and more features are added to Lite XL while
lite is considered feature complete and only allows bug fixes.
Lite XL grew to have slightly different API than lite to support
various use cases, such as multiline editing, regular expressions
and subsyntaxes.

## Where to find plugins and install them?

You can find a list of plugins at our [plugin repository].

To install them, you can use [LPM].
Check out the guide [here] for more instructions.

## Is there an easier way to configure Lite XL without learning Lua?

Yes, since [v2.1.0] we provide an extended package with
additional plugins which provides a GUI for configuring Lite XL.
The packages are prefixed with `lite-xl-(version)-addons`
(e.g. `lite-xl-v2.1.0-addons-windows-x86_64.zip`).

## Can I get smart autocompletion (Intellisense/LSP)?

Check out the [LSP] plugin.

## Where is the integrated terminal?

You can install [lite-xl-terminal].

## Tabs and indent size?

In your user config (the cog icon in the file tree):

```lua
config.tab_type = "soft" -- soft for spaces, hard for real tabs (\t)
config.indent_size = 4   -- 4 spaces
```

## How to enable line wrapping?

Since [v2.1.0], you can enable line wrapping by pressing F10.
Before v2.1.0, only hard wrapping is supported via [autowrap].

## How to bind commands to keys?

```lua
local keymap = require "core.keymap"
keymap.add { ["ctrl+escape"] = "core:quit" }
```

## How to unbind commands for certain keys?

```lua
-- the second parameter lets you override commands for certain keys
-- in this case it maps it to nothing
keymap.add({ ["ctrl+escape"] = {} }, true)
```

## How to get commands for those keybinds?

You can search for commands in the command palette.

For each command, replace the spaces with dashes.

For example: `Core: Find Command` â†’ `core:find-command`

## How to increase all UI size/scale?

There are a few ways of setting the scale:

- If you use the settings plugin, you can find the scale options under Plugins -> Scale
- If you want to set those via Lua, in your user module add

    ```lua
    config.plugins.scale.mode = "ui"
    config.plugins.scale.default_scale = 2
    ```
    
- Set the LITE_SCALE env var

## What version of Lua does Lite XL use?

Lua 5.4, since [v2.1.0], released in late 2022.

Lite XL used Lua 5.2 before [v2.1.0].

## Vim mode?

You need to [vibe].
